# Basic-Login made with Python
This project started as homework for a class but evolved with additional UI features.

# Overview

This basic login system is built using Python Flask and MySQL. It allows users to authenticate using credentials stored in a MySQL database.

Note: Ensure MySQL is installed before trying out this system.

# Inspiration and Tutorial
The initial development was guided by a tutorial from CodeShack. However, the project includes custom features added by me.
